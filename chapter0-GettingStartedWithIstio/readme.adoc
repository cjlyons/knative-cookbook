= Play around with Istio

== Setup Istio
. bash install-istio-demo.sh
.. This step was necessary as the "getting started" install is only good for linux and mac systems
. Verify Istio install
.. kubectl get services
... ClusterIP services should exist for details, kubernetes, productpage, ratings, & reviews  
.. watch kubectl get pods
... wait until all pods are "running". 6 pods: details, productpage, ratings, & reviews (v1, v2, & v3)
. Verify everything is working correctly
.. bash
.. kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=ratings -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -c ratings -- curl -s productpage:9080/productpage | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
... above should return "<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>"
